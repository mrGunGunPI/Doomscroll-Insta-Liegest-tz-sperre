    <h1>Privacy Policy for Doomscroll</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 27, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Doomscroll ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    
    <h3>Physical Activity Data</h3>
    <p>The App requests permission to access your physical activity data (Step Counter). This data is processed locally on your device to convert your steps into "Screen Time" and game points. This data is used solely for the App's core functionality.</p>

    <h3>App Usage Stats</h3>
    <p>The App requests "Usage Access" permissions to detect which apps you are using. This is required to block distracting apps when your time limit expires. This monitoring happens strictly locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>Leaderboard and Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use the Leaderboard feature, specific game data (Nickname, Step Count, Exercise Repetitions, Points) will be synchronized via <strong>Google Firebase Realtime Database</strong>. 
    <br>We implement End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for this data. Your personal game stats are encrypted on your device before being uploaded. Only users with whom you have explicitly shared your unique invite link possess the key to decrypt and view this data.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to facilitate the App's functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used for data synchronization (Leaderboard) and anonymous authentication. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>The App prioritizes data minimization. Since we do not maintain traditional user accounts with email addresses, deleting the App from your device will remove your local data and encryption keys. Data on the Leaderboard is linked to an anonymous ID.</p>

    <h2>4. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
